"For patients suffering from patellofemoral pain syndrome, finding the right balance between rest and exercise is a difficult problem, mostly ignored by the medical community. But understanding how to find this balance could lead to major improvements for patients. This project initial aim is to collect both exercise and symptom data from patients, try to find correlations in the data, potentially look into more possible pain triggers (stress, poor sleep, etc...), and eventually create personal recommendations systems based on AI to help patients better manage their exercise levels and lives. In the longer term, 
the aim is also to extend this kind of approach to other medical conditions."
